          DreamRealNotes Project Introduction and User Manual v1.0

A. Project Introduction

    The DreamRealNotes DApp, a completely decentralized Web3.0 social media platform. Articles, replies, pictures, videos, audios and other data published by users can be permanently stored and exist forever.
    Users can publish articles, replies, pictures, videos, audios, etc. of any length in this DApp system.
    The above types of content posted by users automatically become a different NFT.
    This DApp system has social functions similar to Twitter. Users can post articles, post replies, forward articles, create personal profiles, follow other users, like, give rewards, and so on.

    DApp website:     https://dreamrealnotes.netlify.app/home.html

    This DApp system needs to use the three blockchains of ETH, Arweave, and EOS at the same time. Among them, ETH and Arweave are responsible for storing the content data of articles, pictures, videos, and audios, and the EOS smart contract is responsible for storing their catalog and index data.
    When using the mobile wallet App to access this DApp system, you can only perform browsing and viewing operations, and cannot perform other operations. Because the existing mobile wallet App does not support operations on multiple blockchains at the same time.
    In order to use the full functionality of this DApp system, it is recommended to use a personal computer, Google Chrome, MetaMask plug-in wallet, ArConnect plug-in wallet, and Scatter desktop wallet.

    The main functions that this DApp system has implemented so far are:
    (1) Users can post articles, replies, pictures, videos, and audios.
    (2) Users can create profiles.
    (3) Users can follow other users or unfollow them, view articles published by following users, and so on.

    The main functions that will be implemented in the next step are as follows (Q3 and Q4 2022) :
    (1) Issue incentive Token and NFT.
    (2) Realize the function of liking and rewarding articles and replies.
    (3) Realize the NFT transaction function.

If the displayed number is 10, it means that the first 9 transactions are ETH transfer transactions, and the last one is an EOS on-chain transaction. The larger the length of the article, the higher this number will be. The current setting is that each ETH transfer transaction can send up to 3336 characters. The entire article will be automatically split into multiple parts according to this length, and each transfer transaction sends one of these parts.

17. If there is a transaction failure error message during the process of sending the transaction, such as insufficient ETH balance, insufficient EOS CPU resources, etc., do not refresh the DApp page at this time, but use another wallet or tool to solve the error in the error prompt. Once the error is solved, then click the "Resume from break point" button on the DApp page to continue sending the transaction from the place where the error occurred.

18. After all transactions are successfully sent, wait for a few minutes, click another Tab page at the top of the DApp home page, and then click back, which can refresh the list of articles in the Real Notes and Dream Notes. In the corresponding Tab page, you can see the new article just published. As shown below:

[[[DreamRealNotes:::Link###{ii:17, it:1, sl:6, ohh:~4KttiefHwZNvEZYtpIYwBwVFqmsUf-Vj-F8cyqc1fc4~, osh:~d9b2fa3d296a0bf0c90dc526113e07b38af568ed50a53155dfd51c321a2908b5~}###DreamRealNotes:::Link]]]

20. Double-click the long hash string displayed in the above prompt box with the mouse to select the hash string and copy it to the clipboard. Note that there may be a bug in Google Chrome. Sometimes when you double-click the hash string with the mouse, it shows that the hash string is not completely selected, only a part of it is selected, and some letters are not selected. If this is the case, ignore it, the hash string has been completely and correctly selected.

21. Visit the ETH blockchain browser, the link is: https://etherscan.io, paste the hash string copied in the previous step into the search box, search, and the following page appears:

[[[DreamRealNotes:::Link###{ii:18, it:1, sl:6, ohh:~INva9V7DsQNpU8jUT0xXkD93VPbAu1rqPWaNW5dwFXg~, osh:~24cc10229dab6591e153da1ce145c0f729c56b9302532d48cca1462bd2bd60cd~}###DreamRealNotes:::Link]]]

[[[DreamRealNotes:::Link###{ii:19, it:1, sl:6, ohh:~17o1GL5aRztezFS7c54JyBi_SGFqRxBPp6OoTMxTimU~, osh:~dab49801fa0dc47f4835599c896258e3c480575108776378580b8ceb039e4c57~}###DreamRealNotes:::Link]]]

22. In the Input Data section at the bottom of the page, select "View As UTF8" to see the content of the article. If the {} at the beginning contains a hash string, continue to search for the hash string, and the next part of the article will be searched. Repeat this process until you find one starting with {}, then this is the last part of the article.

23. In the Gas Limit & Usage by Txn section, you can see the actual amount of Gas consumed by the transaction, which is only about 25% of the estimated amount in article "Must Read and Agreement for Community Users".

24. At this point, the verification is completed, and the content of the article has indeed been stored in the ETH block.

25. If the user chooses another storage location when sending the article, the operation process is basically the same.



C. Notes on Using ArConnect Wallet

    ArConnect is a Google Chrome plug-in wallet for the Arweave blockchain. The installation and use method is similar to MetaMask. One difference is that when using the ArConnect wallet to send transactions, it should be noted that the user does not need to click an authorization or confirmation button for each transaction to be sent.
    When users use this DApp system to upload articles, pictures, videos, audios, etc. to the Arweave blockchain, the confirmation window of ArConnect may not pop up after clicking the post button. At this point, please wait patiently for a while. When ArConnect completes the transaction signature and sends the transaction, the entire posting process will continue automatically.
