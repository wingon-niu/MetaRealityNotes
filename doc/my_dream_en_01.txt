               My dream  我的梦想

    Once there was a sincere love in front of me, but I didn't cherish it. I didn't regret it until I lost it. This is the most painful thing in the world. If God could give me another chance, I would say three words to the girl: I love you. If I have to add a deadline to this love, I hope it is: 10000 years!

    Above is a classic movie line.

    Life is like a dream. Back then, I once missed a very good girl. Many years have passed, I still remember her sweet smile, her name is as beautiful as the green grassland. I still remember her birthday, June 26th. It's just that I lacked the courage to pursue her back then, and could only gradually disappear from each other's world as time went on.

    Now, nearly 20 years have passed. My dream is to travel through time and space, go back to the past and pursue her bravely. If I succeed, it will be a happy life. If I don't succeed, I won't leave regrets in life. In fact, more importantly, I hope that girl can know that there is a person who has been missing her silently, from the past, to the present, to the future.

    People should cherish time, cherish opportunities, and cherish the people they meet in life. Once missed, it may be forever regret. What a painful realization.

    Better have a dream, in case it comes true someday.

    I hope this dream can be realized in the future with advanced science and technology.

    Or in the future, in the virtual reality world of the metaverse, this dream can also be fulfilled. Maybe dreams that cannot be realized in reality can be realized in the metaverse in the future. The metaverse is the dream, and the dream is the metaverse.

    Remember our dreams well and look forward to the metaverse in the future.
